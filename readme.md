# Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression
We will implement logistic regression for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, we will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Steps of this project are: 

* Extract features for logistic regression from given some text/tweets
* Implement logistic regression from scratch
* Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
* Test using logistic regression
* Perform error analysis
