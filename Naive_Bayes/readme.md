# Sentiment analysis with Naive Bayes
We will use Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, we will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. Specifically we will: 

* Train a naive bayes model on a sentiment analysis task
* Test our model
* Compute ratios of positive words to negative words
* Do some error analysis
* Predict on our own tweet


## Step 1: Process the Data

For any machine learning project, once we've gathered the data, the first step is to process it to make useful inputs to our model.
- **Remove noise**: we will first want to remove noise from our data -- that is, remove words that don't tell us much about the content. These include all common words like 'I, you, are, is, etc...' that would not give us enough information on the sentiment.
- We'll also remove stock market tickers, retweet symbols, hyperlinks, and hashtags because they can not tell us a lot of information on the sentiment.
- We also want to remove all the punctuation from a tweet. The reason for doing this is because we want to treat words with or without the punctuation as the same word, instead of treating "happy", "happy?", "happy!", "happy," and "happy." as different words.
- Finally we want to use stemming to only keep track of one variation of each word. In other words, we'll treat "motivation", "motivated", and "motivate" similarly by grouping them within the same stem of "motiv-".



## Step 2: Train our model using Naive Bayes

Naive bayes is an algorithm that could be used for sentiment analysis. It takes a short time to train and also has a short prediction time.

#### So how do we train a Naive Bayes classifier?
- The first part of training a naive bayes classifier is to identify the number of classes that we have.
- We will create a probability for each class.
$P(D_{pos})$ is the probability that the document is positive.
$P(D_{neg})$ is the probability that the document is negative.
Use the formulas as follows and store the values in a dictionary:

$$P(D_{pos}) = \frac{D_{pos}}{D}\tag{1}$$

$$P(D_{neg}) = \frac{D_{neg}}{D}\tag{2}$$

Where $D$ is the total number of documents, or tweets in this case, $D_{pos}$ is the total number of positive tweets and $D_{neg}$ is the total number of negative tweets.


#### Prior and Logprior

The prior probability represents the underlying probability in the target population that a tweet is positive versus negative.  In other words, if we had no specific information and blindly picked a tweet out of the population set, what is the probability that it will be positive versus that it will be negative? That is the "prior".

The prior is the ratio of the probabilities $\frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})}$.
We can take the log of the prior to rescale it, and we'll call this the logprior

$$\text{logprior} = log \left( \frac{P(D_{pos})}{P(D_{neg})} \right) = log \left( \frac{D_{pos}}{D_{neg}} \right)$$.

The logprior can also be calculated as the difference between two logs:

$$\text{logprior} = \log (P(D_{pos})) - \log (P(D_{neg})) = \log (D_{pos}) - \log (D_{neg})\tag{3}$$

#### Positive and Negative Probability of a Word
To compute the positive probability and the negative probability for a specific word in the vocabulary, we'll use the following inputs:

- $freq_{pos}$ and $freq_{neg}$ are the frequencies of that specific word in the positive or negative class. In other words, the positive frequency of a word is the number of times the word is counted with the label of 1.
- $N_{pos}$ and $N_{neg}$ are the total number of positive and negative words for all documents (for all tweets), respectively.
- $V$ is the number of unique words in the entire set of documents, for all classes, whether positive or negative.

We'll use these to compute the positive and negative probability for a specific word using this formula:

$$ P(W_{pos}) = \frac{freq_{pos} + 1}{N_{pos} + V}\tag{4} $$
$$ P(W_{neg}) = \frac{freq_{neg} + 1}{N_{neg} + V}\tag{5} $$

Notice that we add the "+1" in the numerator for additive smoothing.  This [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) explains more about additive smoothing.




#### Log likelihood
To compute the loglikelihood of that very same word, we can implement the following equations:

$$\text{loglikelihood} = \log \left(\frac{P(W_{pos})}{P(W_{neg})} \right)\tag{6}$$



##### Calculate the logprior
- the logprior is $log(D_{pos}) - log(D_{neg})$

##### Calculate log likelihood
- Finally, we can iterate over each word in the vocabulary, use your `lookup` function to get the positive frequencies, $freq_{pos}$, and the negative frequencies, $freq_{neg}$, for that specific word.
- Compute the positive probability of each word $P(W_{pos})$, negative probability of each word $P(W_{neg})$ using equations 4 & 5.

$$ P(W_{pos}) = \frac{freq_{pos} + 1}{N_{pos} + V}\tag{4} $$
$$ P(W_{neg}) = \frac{freq_{neg} + 1}{N_{neg} + V}\tag{5} $$

**Note:** We'll use a dictionary to store the log likelihoods for each word.  The key is the word, the value is the log likelihood of that word).

- We can then compute the loglikelihood: $log \left( \frac{P(W_{pos})}{P(W_{neg})} \right)$.



# Step 3: Test our naive bayes

Now that we have the `logprior` and `loglikelihood`, we can test the naive bayes function by making predicting on some tweets!

#### Implement `naive_bayes_predict`
**Instructions**:
Implement the `naive_bayes_predict` function to make predictions on tweets.
* The function takes in the `tweet`, `logprior`, `loglikelihood`.
* It returns the probability that the tweet belongs to the positive or negative class.
* For each tweet, sum up loglikelihoods of each word in the tweet.
* Also add the logprior to this sum to get the predicted sentiment of that tweet.

$$ p = logprior + \sum_i^N (loglikelihood_i)$$



# Step 4: Filter words by Ratio of positive to negative counts

- Some words have more positive counts than others, and can be considered "more positive".  Likewise, some words can be considered more negative than others.
- One way for us to define the level of positiveness or negativeness, without calculating the log likelihood, is to compare the positive to negative frequency of the word.
    - Note that we can also use the log likelihood calculations to compare relative positivity or negativity of words.
- We can calculate the ratio of positive to negative frequencies of a word.
- Once we're able to calculate these ratios, we can also filter a subset of words that have a minimum ratio of positivity / negativity or higher.
- Similarly, we can also filter a subset of words that have a maximum ratio of positivity / negativity or lower (words that are at least as negative, or even more negative than a given threshold).

#### Implement get_ratio
- Given the freqs dictionary of words and a particular word, use `lookup(freqs,word,1)` to get the positive count of the word.
- Similarly, use the `lookup` function to get the negative count of that word.
- Calculate the ratio of positive divided by negative counts

$$ ratio = \frac{\text{pos_words} + 1}{\text{neg_words} + 1} $$

Where pos_words and neg_words correspond to the frequency of the words in their respective classes.
